# Descriptive Statistics Analysis of Basketball Player Performance

## Overview
This project entails a thorough statistical analysis of a basketball player's performance across 40 games, 
aiming to uncover insights into their scoring patterns and overall efficiency. 
Utilizing Python's powerful libraries, we've dissected the player's scoring data to present a comprehensive view of their performance metrics.

## Key Features and Findings
* **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Utilized Pandas to load and prepare the dataset for analysis, ensuring accuracy and reliability in the subsequent statistical evaluation.
* **Statistical Measures:** Calculated fundamental statistical measures such as mean, mode, median, variance, and standard deviation to understand the central tendency and dispersion of scores.
* **Frequency Distributions:** Analyzed the distribution of scores to identify the most common performance patterns and their relative and cumulative frequencies.
* **Graphical Representations:** Employed Matplotlib to create histograms and frequency polygons, visually representing the score distribution and identifying key trends.
* **Confidence Intervals:** Estimated the range within which the average score is likely to fall, using different confidence levels (90%, 95%, and 99%) to assess the reliability of our inferences.
** Hypothesis Testing:** Conducted a t-test to evaluate the statistical significance of the average score against a hypothesized value, providing insights into the player's performance relative to expected outcomes.

## Technology Stack
* Python: Chosen for its flexibility and extensive support for data analysis and scientific computing.
* Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis, offering data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
* Matplotlib: Used for creating a wide variety of static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
