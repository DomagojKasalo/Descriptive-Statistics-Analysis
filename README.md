# Descriptive Statistics Analysis of Basketball Player Performance

## Overview
This is detailed statistical analysis of a basketball player's performance in scoring throughout 40 games, carried out with the intention of revealing the quantity of his scoring and how efficient it was toward team effort. Let's explore deep down into this player's scoring data using Python and its powerful libraries to give us a complete view of his performance metrics.

## Key Features and Findings
* **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Utilized Pandas to load and prepare the dataset for analysis, ensuring accuracy and reliability in the subsequent statistical evaluation.
* **Statistical Measures:** Calculated fundamental statistical measures such as mean, mode, median, variance, and standard deviation to understand the central tendency and dispersion of scores.
* **Frequency Distributions:** Analyzed the distribution of scores to identify the most common performance patterns and their relative and cumulative frequencies.
* **Graphical Representations:** Employed Matplotlib to create histograms and frequency polygons, visually representing the score distribution and identifying key trends.
* **Confidence Intervals:** Estimated the range within which the average score is likely to fall, using different confidence levels (90%, 95%, and 99%) to assess the reliability of our inferences.
** Hypothesis Testing:** Conducted a t-test to evaluate the statistical significance of the average score against a hypothesized value, providing insights into the player's performance relative to expected outcomes.

## Technology Stack
* Python: Chosen for its flexibility and extensive support for data analysis and scientific computing.
* Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis, offering data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
* Matplotlib: Used for creating a wide variety of static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
* SciPy: Applied for performing scientific and technical computing, including statistical tests and confidence interval calculations.
